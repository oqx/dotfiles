# Installation
1. Copy all files to the corresponding directories.
2. Download and install Powerline fonts: https://github.com/powerline/fonts
3. Set your iterm2 text to a Powerline font face and enable non-ascii fonts. You might have to close out preferences after checking "Use a different font for non-ascii text.", as the text selection option may not immediately appear.
4. Close your iterm2 window and open a new one for the changes to take effect.
5. Open vim and run `PlugInstall`
